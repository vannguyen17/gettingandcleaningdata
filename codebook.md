#Introduction

This codebook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

##Data

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The source data for this project can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Variables

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcclerometer-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

##Transformation

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
