#Introduction

This repo contains files for the Getting and Cleaning Data project.

##Contents

README.md - This file.
CodeBook.md - Describes data, variables, and transformations done during data analysis.
run_Analysis.R - R script with more in depth details about each code's function.
tidydata.txt - Output file generated using the run_Analysis.R script.

##Script

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Please see run_Analysis.R for script and in depth details about how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
